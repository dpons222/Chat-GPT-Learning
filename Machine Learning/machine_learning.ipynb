    "## Regression\n",
    "Regression is used to predict outputs that are continuous. The outputs are quantities that can be flexibly determined based on the inputs of the model rather than being confined to a set of possible labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict the height of a potted plant from the amount of rainfall\n",
    "- Predict salary based on someone’s age and availability of high-speed internet\n",
    "- Predict a car’s MPG (miles per gallon) based on size and model yea"

    "## Classification\n",
    "Classification is used to predict a discrete label. The outputs fall under a finite set of possible outcomes. Many situations have only two possible outcomes. This is called **binary classification** (True/False, 0 or 1, Hotdog / not Hotdog).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict whether an email is spam or not\n",
    "- Predict whether it will rain or not\n",
    "- Predict whether a user is a power user or a casual user\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also two other common types of classification: **multi-class classification** and **multi-label classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-class classification** has the same idea behind binary classification, except instead of two possible outcomes, there are three or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predict whether a photo contains a pear, apple, or peach\n",
    "- Predict what letter of the alphabet a handwritten character is\n",
    "- Predict whether a piece of fruit is small, medium, or large\n",
    "\n",
    "An important note about binary and multi-class classification is that in both, each outcome has one specific label. However, in **multi-label classification**, there are multiple possible labels for each outcome. This is useful for customer segmentation, image categorization, and sentiment analysis for understanding text. To perform these classifications, we use models like Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, SVMs, as well as various deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of multi-label classification is shown below. Here, a cat and a bird are both identified in a photo showing a classification model with more than one label as a result.\n",

    "The purpose of machine learning is often to create a model that explains some real-world data, so that we can predict what may happen next, with different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model that we can fit to data is a line. When we are trying to find a line that fits a set of data best, we are performing Linear Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to find lines to fit data, so that we can predict unknowns. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The market price of a house vs. the square footage of a house. Can we predict how much a house will sell for, given its size?\n",
    "- The tax rate of a country vs. its GDP. Can we predict taxation based on a country’s GDP?\n",

    "\n",
    "For each data point, we calculate loss, a number that measures how bad the model’s (in this case, the line’s) prediction was. You may have seen this being referred to as error.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about loss as the squared distance from the point to the line. We do the squared distance (instead of just the distance) so that points above and below the line both contribute to total loss in the same way:\n"
