--------------------------------

Task 1: Array Operations

Create, reshape, and manipulate arrays:

Create an array with the provided quantities.
Reshape the array to a 2x5 matrix.
Modify the array by increasing each quantity by 5.
Broadcasting:

Create an array with the prices.
Apply a 10% discount on prices for the first 5 entries using broadcasting.


Task 2: Mathematical Functions

Built-in functions:
Calculate the total sales for each quantity and price pair.
Compute the sum, mean, and dot product of quantities and prices.


Task 3: Indexing and Slicing

Advanced indexing and slicing:
Extract the first 5 entries of the quantities array.
Modify the extracted array by doubling the quantities.


Task 4: Linear Algebra

Linear algebra functions:
Create a 2D array using quantities and prices.
Compute the inverse of this 2D array (if it meets the criteria for inversion).
Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix.


Task 5: Statistical Operations

Statistical metrics:
Calculate the standard deviation and variance of prices.
Compute the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of prices.
