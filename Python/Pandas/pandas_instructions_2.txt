Additional Pandas Skills
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Learn more about handling missing data (e.g., fillna, interpolate).
Practice data transformation techniques (e.g., applying functions with apply, map).
Merging and Joining DataFrames:

Understand different types of joins (e.g., inner, outer, left, right) using merge and join.
Pivot Tables and GroupBy:

Explore pivot tables for summarizing data.
Practice using groupby for aggregations and transformations.
Advanced Indexing:

Learn about multi-level indexing (hierarchical indexing) and how to manipulate it.
Time Series Analysis:

Work with time series data (e.g., resampling, rolling window calculations).
Efficient Data Processing:

Explore vectorized operations and avoid using loops where possible for performance optimization.

________________________________________________

Task 1: Data Cleaning and Preparation
Handling missing data:

Check for missing values and fill them using fillna or interpolate if necessary.
Drop rows with missing data if appropriate.
Data transformation:

Apply a function to a column using apply.
Use map to transform values in a column.


Task 2: Merging and Joining DataFrames
Types of joins:

Perform different types of joins (inner, outer, left, right) between two DataFrames using merge or join.


Task 3: Pivot Tables and GroupBy
Pivot tables:

Create a pivot table to summarize the data.
GroupBy:

Use groupby to perform aggregations (e.g., sum, mean) and transformations on the data.


Task 4: Advanced Indexing
Multi-level indexing:

Create a DataFrame with multi-level indexing and manipulate it.


Task 5: Time Series Analysis
Time series operations:

Resample the data to a different frequency.
Perform rolling window calculations (e.g., rolling mean) on a time series.


Task 6: Efficient Data Processing
Vectorized operations:

Replace iterative operations with vectorized operations for improved performance.
